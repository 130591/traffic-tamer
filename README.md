# Traffic Tamer: NGINX Microservices Gateway

This project explores NGINX as an API Gateway and Load Balancer for microservices. It demonstrates the use of load balancing algorithms, active/passive health checks, SSL/TLS termination, and rate limiting. Built with Docker and Docker Compose, the goal is to show how NGINX optimizes traffic, increases resilience, and strengthens security in production environments.
